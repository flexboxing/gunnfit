                  <p>This is a rigorous program designed to build muscle, lose fat, and avoid plateaus.  It is an upper/lower body split with one day spent training accessory muscles.  7 of the 12 weeks require you to be in the gym 5 days a week while the other 5 weeks require that you are in the gym 4 days a week.  If you are strict with your rest periods, all lifts can be finished within one hour.<br><br>

Comprised of three 4-week phases</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weeks 1-4: Hypertrophy I</li>
   <li>Weeks 5-8: Hypertrophy II</li>
   <li>Weeks 9-12: Strength</li>
   </ul>
<p>The beauty of this periodized program is that it can be repeated over and over again.  Once you've completed the first 12 weeks, you can start the program again from scratch, except this time you will be working in the original rep range with much greater strength.  </p>

                  <p>Booty blaster is here to take your overall physique - specifically your posterior chain - to the next level. It is strategically split into three lower body days a week with one to two rest days between each.  In addition to the lower body days, you will be performing two upper body days each week. Each workout will conclude with a short HIIT cardio circuit.  This will increase your excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, i.e. will yield a greater total caloric burn.  While the program is designed to last 6 weeks, weeks it can be extended up to 12 weeks and can then be repeated upon conclusion.  If extending the duration of the program, I recommend changing your rep range to 6 reps for weeks 7-9, and 3-4 reps for weeks 10-12.  Once completed, you can move back to Week 1 and increase weight from your initial time going through the program.<br><br><b>This program is not recommended for beginners.</b><br><br><i>*On a dietary note, establish a caloric deficit if your goal is weight/fat loss, or establish a caloric surplus if your goal is gaining mass*</i></p>

                  <p>Are your gains at a halt? Are you having trouble packing on additional mass and or gaining strength? Sick of the same 3 to 4 sets of 10 reps for each and every exercise? If this is the case, it sounds like your routine is lacking volume. GUNNFIT Volume Training is a spin-off of a more well-known program called German Volume Training, otherwise known as the 10x10 method.  The goal is to perform all 100 reps of the primary lifts at the same weight. To make this happen, it is recommended that you start off at a weight that you would be comfortable performing 20 reps <b>to failure</b> (~60% of 1RM) with.  Once you are able to perform all 100 reps at the same weight, you will add an additional 5-10 lbs.  In addition to your primary lifts, you will also perform complimentary lifts in the 8-12 rep range for the muscles trained on that particular day. While the program provided is only designed to last four weeks, it can be extended all the way up to twelve weeks – all you have to do is re-print the program and change the “week” section at the top.  It is essential that you listen to your own body in order to prevent injuries and plateaus. If your body is physically and mentally ready for the challenge and you are continuing to make size & strength gains, continuing it for five, six, seven, or even as many twelve weeks is more than alright. It is especially important to focus on the quality of the movement as opposed to the amount of weight you are lifting. This will provide you the opportunity to make the mind-muscle connection and increase levels of hypertrophy.</p>

                <p>“I’m just lifting for strength” or “I’m just lifting for aesthetics” are two phrases that are used too often in gyms today. Strengthsthetics - a revolutionary program designed to increase your overall physical strength while simultaneously increasing your lean muscle mass (aesthetics) - is here to give you both. Through a scientifically backed approach known as linear periodization, this program will take you through three different phases.  The first phase takes you through the high repetition spectrum of hypertrophy based training, while the second phase takes you through both the intermediate and low repetition spectrum of hypertrophy based training.  Finally, in the third phase, you are in a pure “strength” phase while performing your power reps. “Power” reps exist in each of the three phases and they are to be performed with the sole intention of improving your power and strength. Mixed with the power reps, each phase will also have “slow” sets that are to be performed at an incredibly slow tempo as to increase the time your muscles spend under tension, thus increasing blood flow and the breakdown of your muscle fibers, as well as provide you the opportunity to make the mind-muscle connection and increase levels of hypertrophy.</p>
